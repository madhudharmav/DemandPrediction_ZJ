1. Diff prediction - difference between interactions and intera\actions created 48 hrs ahead
2. No Idletime
3. No XGB drivers calculated
4. Drivers calculated based on average travelling time(+interaction time) and average shift duration
5. Forecast of orders and drivers for Berlin,London and Paris 48 hrs ahead
